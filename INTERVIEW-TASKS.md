# Activate's Interview Project Tasks

Welcome to Activate's interview project! This project is designed to give you the flexibility to work on the tasks at your own pace. Just let us know when you're ready to submit your work.

We’ve structured this project around real-world examples because we’re interested in more than just your coding skills. We want to understand how you approach architecture, problem-solving, and critical thinking.

As you work on these tasks, please follow standard development practices and workflows. Commit your work as you would in a professional environment.

## **Tasks**

### **ACVT001**
Fix the currently failing GetAllUsers_ReturnsListOfUsers test.
- Assert.AreEqual failed. Expected:<Activate.InterviewProject.Core.Models.AppUser (Activate.InterviewProject.Core.Models.AppUser)>. Actual:<Activate.InterviewProject.Core.Models.User (Activate.InterviewProject.Core.Models.User)>

### **ACVT002**
When I log into the app, and I can see the table of users, there is a browser console error: 
- "Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop." 

Fix the console error.

### **ACVT003**
Fix an issue occuring on smaller devices, where users cannot see the edit and delete buttons in the users table.

### **ACVT004**
When I edit a user's details, I can easily pick their "Account type" from the dropdown. That data is currently hard coded on the frontend. Extend the application so that the list of account types is pulled from the database, vs hard coded on the front end.

### **ACVT005**
Fix an issue where the table shown on the normal users tab does not show all of the non-admin users.
